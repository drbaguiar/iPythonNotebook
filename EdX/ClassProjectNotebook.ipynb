    "The mission of Gapminder Foundation is to fight ignorance with a fact-based worldview that everyone can understand. They use surveys to ask representative groups of people simple questions about key-aspects of global development.  When they find large knowledge-gaps, they know what teaching materials we should develop. Gapminder Foundation is a non-profit organization promoting sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels.  Gapminder was founded in Stockholm by Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling Rönnlund and Hans Rosling on February 25, 2005. \n",

    "##Literature Review\n",
    "There is concern that the Internet is playing an increasing role in self-harm and suicide. Internet use may exert both positive and negative effects on young people at risk of self-harm or suicide. The internet has created channels of communication that can be misused to 'cyber-bully' peers; both cyber-bullying and general internet use have been found to correlate with increased risk of self-harm, suicidal idealization, and depression.  Youth who self-harm or are suicidal often make use of the internet. It is most commonly used for constructive reasons such as seeking support and coping strategies, but may exert a negative influence, normalizing self-harm and potentially discouraging disclosure or professional help-seeking. Correlations have been found between internet exposure and violent methods of self-harm.\n",
